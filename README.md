  <summary><h3>Explained</h3></summary>
This panel is a **video time summary**, shown in `hh\:mm\:ss` format:

* **Watch: 00:04:54** ‚Üí At your current playback speed, finishing this video will take 4 minutes and 54 seconds.
* **Saved: 00:01:57 (28.6%)** ‚Üí This means you have **saved 1 minute and 57 seconds of actual watch time** compared to normal speed (1x), which equals 28.6% of the video duration.
